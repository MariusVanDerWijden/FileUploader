# FileUploader
This is a small project enabling you to upload files to a Server, 
meant to be used as a USB-replacement cause I couldn't find any working USB-Sticks around here. 
Can be used to swap files at a LAN-party


There's a description of the protocol I invented in src/tools/protocol/Protocol.png

The project contains a Server and a Client part, completely written in java.

Feel free to copy and modify the shit out of this
